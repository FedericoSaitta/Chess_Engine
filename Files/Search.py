'''
This file is responsible for:
- Searching for the best move in the game tree with an iterative deepening approach
- Ordering moves by: Hash Move > 2 Killer Moves > MVV/LLA Sorted Moves > The Remaining Moves

Notes:
- In a chess engine the Search module is where the greatest improvements and mistakes can be made, tuning to allow for
  the most amount of pruning while retaining accuracy should be the programmer's no.1 task.
- Negamax with alpha beta allows to prune not so promising branches, ultimately the speed of the engine is determined
  by how many branches we explore to arrive at the best move, good move ordering is the most important factor.
- Quiescence search instead is needed to avoid 'Horizon Effect', this is key to an accurate evaluation of the board.

Resources:
- Horizon effect: https://www.chessprogramming.org/Horizon_Effect
- MVV/LLA Table, Killer Moves: https://rustic-chess.org/front_matter/title.html
- Negamax: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negamax
- Quiescence Search: https://www.dailychess.com/rival/programming/quiescence.php # This has a lot of good tips

Possible improvements:
- Try one or three Killer move approach
- Creating special generators for the quiescence search
- Applying History heuristics (note that your move ordering function isn't called that much so it is important that it is
  good
- Applying principal variation search

Failed improvements:
- Null Move pruning, I believe it is because my engine does not search to great depths
